				<p>Hey, maybe you could pop a tent outside with your cousin Maeby… it'd be a good chance to rub off on her. There are dozens of us! DOZENS! I will pack your sweet pink mouth with so much ice cream you'll be the envy of every Jerry and Jane on the block! I made a huge tiny mistake. One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! Hahahaha. So you take your mom to work every day? Bummer. Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh? It's, like, die already!</p>
